# Hello World

Example webpack-configuration code + set-up learned from the [React from the Ground up Section 9, Lecture 28](https://www.udemy.com/reactjs-from-the-ground-up)


## Usage

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ronizzle/react-node-hello-world.git
$ cd react-node-hello-world
$ npm start
```

## Output
Opening http://localhost:8080 on your browser will display:
> Hello world!

## Notes
You need the following installed:
1. [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)

You might encounter a bunch of errors upon executing ```npm start``` so this command will display the latest error encountered by the webpack
```webpack --display-error-details```
